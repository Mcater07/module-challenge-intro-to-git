## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a version control system and keeps track of all changes made on file to the computer.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is the system where keeps track of all changes made on computer, Git Hub is the place where we store local repositories on to online form. store code

3. Why do we create a branch? branches are sections you work on if you are fixing a bug or working on something, then it is sent back to the main branch to be add back in.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? A pull request helps you collaborate on code with other people. how you get code from a feature branch or a fixed bug into your main branch.


5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. cd .. or cd ~

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git fetch is when you are retrieve new work done by other people review changes before commiting them to local branch, git merge is Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another . Git pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.


7. What is a merge conflict? Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? You can only resolve merge conflicts on GitHub that are caused by competing line changes, such as when people make different changes to the same line of the same file on different branches in your Git repository. For all other types of merge conflicts, you must resolve the conflict locally on the command line. For more information, see "Resolving a merge conflict using the command line."
